This is our placeholder for the JS13K Games Competiton (2018).

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/irlbayarea/js13k-2018.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/irlbayarea/js13k-2018)

So far this is just boilerplate (i.e. webpack, typescript) and nothing related
to the game, which won't be started until 2018/08/13. The current version of
this game (at MASTER, not necessarily stable) is located at
https://irlbayarea.github.io/js13k-2018/.
